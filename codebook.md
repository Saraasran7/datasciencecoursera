# Code Book for Tidy Dataset

This tidy data set contains the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

## Variables

- `subject`: Identifier of the subject who performed the activity (1 to 30).
- `activity`: Activity performed (e.g., WALKING, SITTING).
- The remaining variables are the mean values of the measurements of mean and standard deviation for accelerometer and gyroscope signals from the smartphone.

The variables are named according to the features info from the original dataset, for example:

- `tBodyAcc-mean()-X`: Mean body acceleration in X direction.
- `tBodyAcc-std()-Y`: Standard deviation of body acceleration in Y direction.

For full details of the variables, refer to the `features.txt` file in the original dataset.
